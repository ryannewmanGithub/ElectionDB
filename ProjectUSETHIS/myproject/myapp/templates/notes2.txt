Serializable isolation level for add/edit/delete because we want high consistency

Read uncommitted for report feature because we want high concurrency and its ok if the 
aggregate statistics are a little bit inaccurate.

Lessons Learned:
Mistake was that I started with a basic schema and developed immediately.
I could not change the schema after developing unless I wanted to redo things.
Next time, I would have paid more attention to the design of my database before writing the code.

Was very glad to learn how to combine ORM and Django to develop this database application.
